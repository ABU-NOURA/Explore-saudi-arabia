      <h2>Antique Port City on the Red Sea</h2>
      <p>
        Located in the province of Madinah, Yanbu is the second largest port city on the 
        Red Sea after Jeddah. It also happens to be one of the oldest seaports on the 
        Red Sea. It serves as the major port for the holy city of Madinah. Yanbu not 
        only plays an important role in the economy of the country but also holds historical 
        importance for being a major port for receiving pilgrims. Traditionally, the economy 
        of Yanbu has been associated with the pilgrimage route, trade, and export of dates.
        The port is being expanded to take some pressure off the Jeddah port.
        <br><br>
        Yanbu has a natural harbor and offers some great views of the Red Sea. 
        It has wide coral reefs that remain largely unspoiled. This area is great 
        for water activities like scuba diving, fishing, and birdwatching. There are 
        also three oil refineries in the city and it is a major petroleum shipping hub. 
        It also houses an industry for plastics as well as other petrochemical products. 
        Three major pipelines terminate in this region. In terms of climate, Yanbu has a 
        very hot desert climate all year round. It is well connected to other major cities 
        like Jeddah. It is also connected to neighboring countries like Syria and Jordan.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Yanbu has a history dating back approximately 2500 years. It used to be the main 
        shipping terminal on the historic Incense trade route that passed from Yemen and 
        Egypt to the Mediterranean countries. Diodorus Siculus, the famous Greek historian 
        has also mentioned  Sharm Yanbu (Charmuthas) in his work.
        <br><br>
        During the time of the Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him), Yanbu came under Muslim 
        rule after the Ghazwah Zul-Ushairah. Between 150 and 200 followers joined this 
        conquest to al-Ushayra, in the Yanbu region. Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) made 
        an agreement with the local tribe, Banu Madlaj, which inhabited the area.
        <br><br>
        At the time of World War I, Yanbu was the operational base of the British and Arab 
        forces that were fighting the Ottomans. In 1916, the Ottomans surrendered Yanbu. 
        After this, it remained a relatively small port town up until 1975 when it became a 
        major industrial center of Saudi Arabia. The city saw rapid development and massive 
        infrastructure projects after this.

        Yanbu is divided into three distinct regions.

        Yanbu Al-Bahr, the northernmost region of Yanbu contains most of the population. 
        The old area, also called Al Balad contains many restaurants that offer traditional 
        cuisines to the expats living in the area. Some international chains are also present 
        here. A shopping mall also serves the needs of the residents. A flower competition is 
        held here every year. Many old, historical buildings are located here and the 
        government is trying to modernize the sites that are in a dilapidated condition.
        <br><br>
        Yanbu Al-Nakhl (The Palms) is the second main area that contains around 20 villages 
        and farms. Some of these include Jabriyya, Suwaiq, Raihan, Mesharif, Ain-Ajlan, 
        Madsos, Alnejil and Talaat Nazah. It is mostly inhabited by local tribes who own and 
        work on the farms. Jabriyya is the most notable village in this region. A local 
        government office, ATM, general hospital, shopping malls, as well as recreational 
        facilities. The Radwah Mountain can be seen clearly from here. 
        <br><br>
        Yanbu Al-Sina'iya (the industrial Yanbu) was established in 1975 with the aim to 
        build a modern industrial city in the southern part of Yanbu. This area is further 
        subdivided into the industrial area and the residential area (Royal Commission). 
        Major oil refineries and factories are situated in the industrial area while the 
        residential area has modern housing facilities and all the necessary amenities.
