    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Saudi Arabia traces its roots back to the earliest civilizations of the Arabian 
      Peninsula. Over the centuries, the peninsula has played an important role in 
      history as an ancient trade center and as the birthplace of Islam, one of the 
      world’s major monotheistic religions.
      <br><br>
      Since King Abdulaziz Al-Saud established the modern Kingdom of Saudi 
      Arabia in 1932, its transformation has been astonishing.
      <br><br>
      a few short decades, the Kingdom has turned itself from a desert 
      nation to a modern, sophisticated state and a major player on the 
      international stage.
     </p>
  
    <h2>Early History</h2>
    <p>
      The first concrete evidence of human presence in the Arabian Peninsula 
      dates back 15,000 to 20,000 years. Bands of hunter-gatherers roamed the 
      land, living off wild animals and plants.
      <br><br>
      As the European ice cap melted during the last Ice Age, some 15,000 years 
      ago, the climate in the peninsula became dry. Vast plains once covered with 
      lush grasslands gave way to scrubland and deserts, and wild animals vanished. 
      River systems also disappeared, leaving in their wake the dry river beds 
      (wadis) that are found in the peninsula today.
      <br><br>
      This climate change forced humans to move into the lush mountain valleys 
      and oases. No longer able to survive as hunter-gatherers, they had to 
      develop another means of survival. As a result, agriculture developed – first 
      in Mesopotamia, then the Nile River Valley, and eventually spreading 
      across the Middle East.
      <br><br>
      The development of agriculture brought other advances. Pottery allowed 
      farmers to store food. Animals, including goats, cattle, sheep, horses and 
      camels, were domesticated, and people abandoned hunting altogether. These 
      advances made intensive farming possible. In turn, settlements became more 
      permanent, leading to the foundations of what we call civilization – language, 
      writing, political systems, art and architecture.      
    </p>
  
    <h2>An Ancient Trade Center</h2>
   <P>
    Located between the two great centers of civilization, the Nile River Valley 
    and Mesopotamia, the Arabian Peninsula was the crossroads of the ancient world. 
    Trade was crucial to the area’s development; caravan routes became trade 
    arteries that made life possible in the sparsely populated peninsula.
    <br><br>
    The people of the peninsula developed a complex network of trade routes to 
    transport agricultural goods highly sought after in Mesopotamia, 
    the Nile Valley and the Mediterranean Basin. These items included almonds 
    from Taif, dates from the many oases, and aromatics such as frankincense 
    and myrrh from the Tihama plain.
    <br><br>
    Spices were also important trade items. They were shipped across the Arabian 
    Sea from India and then transported by caravan.
    <br><br>
    The huge caravans traveled from what is now Oman and Yemen, along the great 
    trade routes running through Saudi Arabia’s Asir Province and then through 
    Makkah and Madinah, eventually arriving at the urban centers of the north 
    and west.
    <br><br>
    The people of the Arabian Peninsula remained largely untouched by the 
    political turmoil in Mesopotamia, the Nile Valley and the eastern 
    Mediterranean. Their goods and services were in great demand regardless of 
    which power was dominant at the moment – Babylon, Egypt, Persia, Greece or 
    Rome. In addition, the peninsula’s great expanse of desert formed a natural 
    barrier that protected it from invasion by powerful neighbors.    
   </P>

    <h2>The Birth of Islam</h2>
    <p>
      Around the year 610, Muhammad, a native of the thriving commercial center of 
      Makkah, received a message from God (in Arabic, Allah) through the Angel 
      Gabriel. As more revelations bid him to proclaim the oneness of God 
      universally, the Prophet Muhammad’s following grew.
      <br><br>
      In 622, learning of an assassination plot against him, the Prophet led his 
      followers to the town of Yathrib, which was later named Madinat Al-Nabi 
      (City of the Prophet) and now known simply as Madinah. This was the Hijrah, 
      or migration, which marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar.
      <br><br>
      Within the next few years, several battles took place between the 
      followers of the Prophet Muhammad and the pagans of Makkah. By 628, 
      when Madinah was entirely in the hands of the Muslims, the Prophet had 
      unified the tribes so successfully that he and his followers reentered
      Makkah without bloodshed.

    </p>
  
    <h2>The Islamic Empire</h2>
    <p>
      Less than 100 years after the birth of Islam, the Islamic Empire extended 
      from Spain to parts of India and China. Although the political centers of 
      power had moved out of the Arabian Peninsula, trade flourished in the area.
      <br><br>
      Also, a large number of pilgrims began regularly visiting the peninsula, 
      with some settling in the two holy cities of Makkah and Madinah. These 
      pilgrims facilitated the exchange of ideas and cultures between the people 
      of the peninsula and other civilizations of the Arab and Muslim worlds.
      <br><br>
      The emergence of Arabic as the language of international learning was 
      another major factor in the cultural development of the Arabian Peninsula. 
      The Muslim world became a center for learning and scientific advances 
      during what is known as the “Golden Age.” Muslim scholars made major 
      contributions in many fields, including medicine, biology, philosophy, 
      astronomy, arts and literature. Many of the ideas and methods pioneered 
      by Muslim scholars became the foundation of modern sciences.
      <br><br>
      The Islamic Empire thrived well into the 17th century, when it broke up 
      into smaller Muslim kingdoms. The Arabian Peninsula gradually entered a 
      period of relative isolation, although Makkah and Madinah remained the 
      spiritual heart of the Islamic world and continued to attract pilgrims 
      from many countries.
