      continuously inhabited since prehistoric times, serving as a crossroads for various civilizations,

    <h2>Geography and Climate</h2>
    <p>
      Al-Ahsa is characterized by its diverse geography, featuring an expansive oasis, deserts,
      and mountains. The oasis is one of the largest in the world and is fed by abundant underground 
      springs, making the region fertile and ideal for agriculture. Here, you will find vast date palm 
      plantations and various other crops thriving amidst the arid surroundings. The climate in Al-Ahsa 
      is typically desert-like, with scorching summers and mild winters.
