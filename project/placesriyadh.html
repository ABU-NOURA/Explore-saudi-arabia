    <h2>Cultural Capital of Saudi Arabia</h2>
    <p>
      The word Riyadh is derived from the Arabic word ​​rawḍah which means
      ‘gardens’ or ‘meadows’. This is in reference to the immense fertility and
      lush green gardens of the area. Riyadh city is not only the administrative and political capital
      of the country but is also referred to as the cultural capital of Saudi Arabia due to the various 
      cultural centres in the city like the King Abdulaziz Historical Center (National Museum).
      <br><br>
      Riyad saw a rapid transformation from being a small desert village to a modern city with tall
      skyscrapers. The 99 story tall Kingdom Center is an iconic landmark of the city and ranks as the fifth
      tallest skyscraper in the country. The city of Riyadh is situated at the centre of the Arabian
      peninsula, a historically important trade route that offers a great fusion of different cultures and
      traditions.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
     The first mention of Riyadh is recorded by an Arab chronicler and dates back to 1590. 
     The city was established on the ruins of the ancient city of Hajr in the Yamamah region.
     This place used to be the epicentre of the trade caravans. Originally a fortified village,
     Its rapid growth from the 17th century onwards has been truly astounding. It continued to serve as
     the capital for the ruling dynasties thought history and with the proclamation of the unified Kingdom
     of Saudi Arabia in 1932, it was made the capital of Saudi Arabia.
     <br><br>
     At Turaif is the historical district in Riyadh which was the home royal family
     of Saudi Arabia until 1818. It is only a 30 minute drive from King Khalid International Airport
     and has recently been restored as part of the billion dollar Diriyah Gate Project. 
     <br><br>
     At Turaif was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2010 and is now known as the At Turaif
     UNESCO World Heritage Site. Visitors to At Turaif can also visit the nearby Al Buraiji Heritage
     Park and Buraiji Terrace which offers world class restaurants and cafes.
