    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Before World War I, the city of Abha was under Ottoman control. In 1920 it was 
      conquered by the Ikhwan tribesmen and became part of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 
      For most of history, the region was cut off from the rest of the world due to its 
      geography. The mountainous region started gaining prominence when the Saudi 
      government started promoting it as a tourist destination. Abha quickly caught the 
      interest of tourists due to its favorable climate and ancient history. 
      <br><br>
      Hilltop fortresses are a characteristic of the city. The Shadda Palace, established 
      in 1820 used to be the main ruling palace of Abha. It has now been converted into a 
      museum and houses some interesting artefacts of the region. The city contains the 
      Abha great mosque and countless other mosques including some really ancient ones.

    <h2>Geography</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes it may seem that Abha is perched on the clouds. Surrounded by tall, 
      imposing mountains, the city is often covered in fog. You will also find fertile 
      plains and deep valleys in the area. The city itself is situated at a height 
      of 2,270 meters above sea level. The tallest mountain of Saudi Arabia, 
      Jabal Sawda is also right next to the city. Visitors can ride a cable car 
      to the summit of the mountain.
      <br><br>
      The climate of Abha remains mild throughout the year. It is very rare for the 
      temperature to rise above 35°C. The lowest temperature ever recorded in the 
      city was −2°C and the city receives a decent amount of rain. The rainy season 
      typically lasts from the months of February to April. Due to the rain and mild 
      climate, the city has a lot of natural greenery.

    <h2>Cultural Life</h2>
    <p>
      Abha has a distinctive and rich culture that has been passed on across 
      generations. The city is a lively place and events like the Abha festival 
      are held to promote the culture of the city. Different sports, events, 
      festivals, and exhibitions, along with poetry and musical performances, 
      are held in the city. The city also has a public university, 
      King Khalid University. 
      <br><br>
      The culture of the city is best experienced by observing the intricately 
      designed houses. These large, fortress-like houses are designed vertically. 
      This helps the heat escape and trap in the cool air. Residents also use bright 
      colors to paint their houses. The materials used in constructing these 
      traditional residential units are clay, stone, and wood.
