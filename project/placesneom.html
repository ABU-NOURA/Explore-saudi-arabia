    <h2>What is NEOM?</h2>

    <h2>Naming NEOM</h2>
    <p>
    Coming from the future, before it was even launched, this is how NEOM came 
    about, and this is how its founder, His Royal Highness, Crown Prince Mohammed 
    bin Salman, envisioned it, as he laid its foundations to be the future, an 
    agent of progress and change. It was therefore expected that “future” be 
    intertwined with NEOM’s basic identity, its name, its values and its vision, 
    and this is how NEOM is… from the future and to the future
    </p>
  
    <h2>A NAME WORTHY OF A DREAM PROJECT </h2>
    <P>
      The Crown Prince and Chairman of the NEOM Board of Directors, His Royal 
      Highness Prince Mohammed bin Salman, discussed and deliberated with 
      members of the project’s Founding Board - in addition to experts and 
      specialists in the field - about an appropriate name for such a project 
      with a global outlook. When the Board conducted its first meetings to 
      address related topics, among the agenda items was the search for a name 
      that represents the identity and symbolism of this dream project, as HRH 
      saw that the name expresses the cultural and civilizational dimension of 
      the universality of the project. A series of discussions were circulated 
      about the significance of the name and how it should reflect the project’s 
      global identity, human dimension and remarkable ambition
    </P>
  
    <h2>NO STONE WAS LEFT UNTURNED</h2>
   <P>
    The actual name designation journey began by defining criteria, 
    qualities and conditions, all of which bear a clear and firm vision for 
    selection; then, sorting and testing the lists of names proposed by the 
    consulting team. The list included 2,000 names, which was further 
    reduced - as per the standards and requirements - to 150 names, and then 
    reduced again to five names. However, none of them was chosen or agreed upon.
    <br><br>
    During the Founding Board discussions, some members considered giving the 
    project the name of HRH, the President of the Founding Board, either 
    directly or by incorporating his name within the project name. As such, 
    two names were suggested: "NEOVIA MBS" and "NMBS," but the opinions of the 
    members were split. The team that was not in favor clarified that HRH, the 
    Chairman of the Board, leads major national projects, and HRH being Chairman 
    of NEOM Board of Directors is sufficient to deliver a message to the world 
    that reflects the direct connection of HRH to the project. They did, however, 
    support HRH's principal idea that the name should be neither Eastern nor 
    Western, and also not belonging to a specific language or culture, in addition 
    to being neutral and rather open to the entire world.

   </P>
    <h2>A SUM OF ALL ITS PARTS</h2>
    <p>
      The Board members then brainstormed for words representing the project 
      sectors and its basic pillars. What followed was choosing the initials 
      of those sectors and merging them to obtain a distinctive name that 
      preserves the identity of the project, and this resulted in the name 
      "NEO MSTACBEL," whose initials MSTACBEL symbolize the main project 
      sectors, such as Media, Sport, Technology and Energy. And then the 
      word was abbreviated and symbolized by the letter M, meaning "Mim" 
      in Arabic as a symbol for two words: It is the first letter of the 
      Arabic word for future (mustaqbal) and also the first letter of the 
      name of HRH Prince "Mohammed" bin Salman. Then the letter "M" 
      was merged with the word "NEO" from the Greek language, which means 
      new, to form the name that constitutes the beacon of change in the 
      world. The name "NEOM" was henceforth formed and agreed upon 
      unanimously by the Board 
    </p>
  
    <h2>THE TRUE REFLECTION OF A VISION</h2>
    <p>
      Thus, the name NEOM was formed with the approval and endorsement of the 
      Founding Board as the official name of the project; a true reflection of 
      NEOM’s vision and the reality that will be achieved - Allah willing - to 
      contribute to building a promising future for future generations. 
      From that moment on, the lights of NEOM have pierced the sky, heralding a 
      luminous dawn, a promising future, and a rich life in a land built by man 
      for the sake of all humanity.
    </p>
      
  
    <h2>The Line</h2>
    <p>
      Main article: The Line, Saudi Arabia
      <br><br>
      In January 2021, the project unveiled plans for The Line, 
      a linear city 170 kilometres (110 mi) long and 200 metres (660 ft) 
      wide within the Neom area. The design for The Line was further modified 
      in July 2022, scrapping the original idea for multiple buildings on a 
      linear plan, instead combining the buildings into one continuous 
      structure with an entirely glass mirror exterior. The car-free 
      city is planned to be large enough to house nine million residents 
      within walkable communities, with all basic services within a 
      five-minute walking distance

    <h2>Oxagon</h2>
    <p>
      Oxagon (originally named Neom Industrial City) will be a floating 
      industrial complex in the shape of an octagon. It will be located around 
      25 kilometres (16 mi) north of the town of Duba, and covers roughly 200–250 
      square kilometres (77–97 sq mi) of land, of which approximately 40 square 
      kilometres (15 sq mi) forms the city. The project will focus on modern 
      manufacturing, industrial research and development centered on expanding 
      the Duba port. Mohammed bin Salman expects Oxagon to become "a new 
      focal point for global trade flows" and service shipping routes through 
      the Red Sea. The plans for the complex include a desalination plant, a 
      hydrogen plant and an oceanographic research center. It will also be 
      home to the cognitive multinational company Tonomus (originally NEOM Tech & 
      Digital Company), which is the first subsidiary company to evolve from NEOM.
      <br><br>
      On December 16, 2022, Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Industry and Mineral 
      Resources, the Saudi Authority for Industrial Cities and Technology 
      Zones and Neom signed a memorandum of understanding to facilitate 
      collaboration and legislation in support of Neom's Future Factories Program.
      <br><br>
      As of January 2023, Neom has not provided any information regarding how the 
      complex will remain afloat.

    <h2>Trojena</h2>
    <p>
      On 3 March 2022, Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman launched the 
      Trojena project, which will be the first major outdoor skiing destination 
      in the Arabian Peninsula. It will be located about 50 kilometres (31 mi) 
      from the Gulf of Aqaba coast in the Sarwat Mountains, with elevations 
      ranging from 1,500–2,600 metres (4,900–8,500 ft). Although it is in the 
      desert, the site's climate is considerably cooler than is the rest of 
      Neom's territory. Ennismore, a lifestyle and hospitality company, 
      was announced as the inaugural partner with its brands 25hours Hotels 
      and Morgans Originals.[44][45] In September 2023, Zaha Hadid Architects 
      designed a 330 m (1,080 ft) tall skyscraper for Trojena which will stand 
      on a mountain overlooking an artificial lake. Renders of the skyscraper, 
      which will be connected to the lakeside development by a cable car, showed a 
      crystalline structure made of numerous columns that narrow towards the peak

    <h2>Sindalah</h2>
    <p>
      In December 2022, Neom announced plans for Sindalah, a 1,100,000 cubic yards 
      luxury resort complex off the city coast. It is planned to have an 86-berth 
      marina and three luxury hotels, and it could accommodate as many as 2,400 
      visitors daily.9 hole golf course overlooking the sea was constructed in 2023
