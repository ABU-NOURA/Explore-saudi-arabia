    <h2>Administrative hub of the oil industry</h2>
    <p>
      Dammam is a spectacularly modern city. It is not only the capital of the Eastern Province 
      but also the sixth most populous city in Saudi Arabia. After the discovery of oil in 1938, 
      the city rapidly transformed from a traditional coastal village into a contemporary metropolis 
      with state-of-the-art infrastructure and all the modern amenities.
      <br><br>
      With striking views of the Arabian Gulf, the city offers peaceful waterfronts, 
      lush green parks, and spotless beaches. Dammam is home to a sizable population of expatriates. 
      It is not just the administrative hub of the Saudi oil industry but is also reinventing itself 
      as a hub for sports, art, science, and entertainment. Visitors will find plenty to do and plenty 
      of places to visit in Dammam, including street art exhibitions which are quickly becoming one of 
      the city’s leading attractions.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      The area that is now Dammam used to be a fishing village that was settled by the Dawasir 
      tribe around 1923 with permission from King Ibn Saud. After the discovery of oil from 
      the famous Dammam Well No. 7, the city saw an overnight transformation into an administrative 
      centre for the Saudi oil industry. The urban housing, infrastructure as well as industry also 
      developed in parallel to the oil infrastructure.  
      <br><br>
      During its 50 years of rapid growth, Dammam ranked as the world’s 10th fastest growing city in 
      terms of population. Even today, Dammam is growing at an exceptionally fast growth rate of 12% a 
      year. This makes it the fastest growing city in Saudi Arabia as well as the Arab world.

    <h2>Geography</h2>
   <p>
    The geography of the region is similar to the rest of the Eastern Province. Harsh desert 
    conditions and temperatures persist throughout most of the year, making the climate mostly 
    arid. Rainfall occurs very sparsely, only in the winter months only and hailstorms have 
    also been recorded in the region. 
    <br><br>
    Despite the overall extremely hot weather, the proximity to the Arabian Gulf offers visitors 
    and tourists a respite from the heat. The beaches are immaculate. Walkways on the coastline 
    allow visitors to benefit from the wonderful views while also enjoying the sea breeze.
   </p>
   
    <h2>Cultural Life</h2>
    <p>
      The rapid growth and expansion of the city have been supported by the latest infrastructure 
      development. New roads and highways connect Dammam to other major cities in the country. 
      The city is served by the largest airport in the world in terms of land area, the King 
      Fahd International airport. Dammam also boasts the second largest and second busiest 
      seaport in Saudi Arabia, King Abdul Aziz Sea Port.
      <br><br>
      The oil industry, as well as the rapdily-evolving infrastructure and amenities, attracted 
      not only locals from other areas of the country but also foreign nationals from a 
      host of different countries. This has led to a truly diverse and rich culture. You can 
      hear different languages being spoken by expatriates and experience the best of all 
      cultures in Dammam. The city also has different entertainment facilities, including 
      new amusement parks that are being built. Sports fans will discover that the city loves 
      football and plays host to different football events and tournaments at the Prince 
      Mohammed bin Fahd Stadium. Additionally, South Asian expatriates have also brought 
      cricket with them to the city.
