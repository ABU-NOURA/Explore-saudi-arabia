    <h2>Location</h2>
    <p>
      Az Zulfi is in the East of Al-Qassim Province and at the heart of the historical 
      region of Najd. It is located roughly 70kilometers from Buraydah 
      (the capital of the province) and more than 290 kilometers north of the 
      Saudi capital, Riyadh.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      Early history
      <br><br>
      Although the location is sometimes identified with an ancient settlement mentioned 
      by Yaqut and Al-Hamadani known as Oryarh, the history of Zulfi proper dates back to 
      the third[clarification needed] century. According to the chroniclers of Nejd.
      <br><br>
      During the Pre-Islamic era the settlement at the site was called zulifit or alkrm 
      (Arabic: الزلفات و الكَرَمُ), and was reportedly founded by the tribe of 
      Banu Hanifa and Banu tmym. Hajr served as the capital of the province of Al 
      Yamamah, whose governors were responsible for most of central and eastern Arabia 
      during the Umayyad and Abbasid eras. Al-Yamamah broke away from the Abbasid Empire 
      in 866 and the area fell under the rule of the Ukhaydhirites, who moved the capital 
      from Hajr to nearby Al Kharj. The city then went into a long period of decline. 
      In the 14th century, North African traveller Ibn Battuta wrote of his visit to Hajr, 
      describing it as "the main city of Al-Yamamah, and its name is Hajr". 
      Ibn Battuta goes on to describe it as a city of canals and trees with most of its 
      inhabitants belonging to Bani Hanifa, and reports that he continued on with their 
      leader to Mecca to perform the Hajj.
      <br><br>
      Later on, Hajr broke up into several separate settlements and estates. 
      The most notable of these were Migrin (or Muqrin) and Mi'kal, though the name 
      Hajr continued to appear in local folk poetry. The earliest known reference to 
      the area by the name Riyadh comes from a 17th-century chronicler reporting on an 
      event from the year 1590. In 1737, Deham ibn Dawwas, a refugee from neighboring 
      Manfuha, took control of Riyadh. Ibn Dawwas built a single wall to encircle the 
      various quarters of Riyadh, making them effectively a single town.

    <h2>Geography</h2>
   <p>
    Al Zulfi lies in the northern-central region of the Najd and to the south of 
    the Sheayb Samnan (Samnan Valley), which is the longest valley on the Zulfi. 
    It is surrounded by sand dunes to its north and west, which are known locally 
    as the Al-Thoyr Sands. The Al-sabalh Woods are located to the north of the city. 
    Next to Al Zulfi is the Al-Kasar Rain lake (or Bohyrat Al-Kasar), which is 
    considered an official part of the city.
