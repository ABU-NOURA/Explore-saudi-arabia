    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>

      and poetry. The famous Arabian knight and poet Antarah bin Shaddad also

    <h2>Geography</h2>
   <P>
    Qassim province is located in the geographical center of Saudi Arabia. 
    This region is called the Najd region. Saudi Arabia’s longest valley, 
    the 600 km long Wadi al-Rummah crosses the province from the west towards the 
    northeast. Even though this valley is mostly dry now but according to historians 
    it used to be a major river that flowed from Makkah to the Arabian Gulf thousands 
    of years ago. Due to this the region still has a generous amount of groundwater 
    that helps make it one of the greenest regions in Saudi Arabia with an abundant 
    agricultural yield. The climate of Qassim province is dry and hot just like most 
    of the country.
