    <h2>Capital of the Jizan Province</h2>
    <p>
      Jazan City is an important port city situated on the Red Sea. 
      It is the capital of the Jazan Province. Being located on the pristine coast 
      of the Red Sea gives the city incredible views. It is not only an important 
      seaport of Saudi Arabia but is also famous as a popular tourist destination. 
      The incredible beauty and natural diversity of the region have attracted the 
      attention of local as well as international tourists. 
      <br><br>
      Jazan is the most important city of the Tihamah coastal plain. These coastal 
      plains extend along the coast of the Red Sea. The area surrounding Jizan is 
      distinct in the sense that it does not have the typical huge sand dunes that 
      are a distinct part of the Saudi Arabian desert. Instead, you will find 
      low-lying, white sand dunes here. The Farasan Islands are situated opposite 
      Jazan City at a distance of approximately 40 km. These Islands are a jewel 
      of the Red Sea and offer unparalleled and unspoiled biodiversity.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      The history of the city dates back centuries. Artifacts discovered in the 
      surrounding areas have been dated back to the Bronze Age. The city played an 
      important role throughout history due to its strategic location along the 
      maritime trade route. The Romans expanded maritime trade through the Red Sea 
      and this region played a crucial part in sustaining their economy. The Jizan 
      province became part of the Muslim Empire in the 7th century CE. During the 
      Ottoman period, a number of forts were built in the region. The Dosrih fort 
      and the one in the Farasan Islands are two great examples of their architecture. 
      Even during World War II, the Germans built a fort on the Farasan islands due to 
      its strategic location.  
      <br><br>
      During the early 20th century Jazan used to be a major site for pearl fishing. 
      After the onset of  World War I, this industry was shut down. Today, Jazan is 
      home to important agricultural developments. The outskirts of the city are 
      rapidly being developed into agricultural powerhouses. Apart from agriculture, 
      the region also plays an important role in the energy and tourism sector. 
      Jazan Economic City was established recently and we are seeing a number of 
      mega projects being initiated in the region.
      <br><br>
      Jazan Refinery is one such megaproject under construction and owned 
      by Saudi Aramco. The Refinery is set to process heavy and medium crude 
      oil to create liquefied petroleum gas along with other important byproducts. 
      It is expected to have a massive output of 400,000 barrels per day. Jazan is 
      also an important part of Saudi Arabia's naval industry.

    <h2>Geography</h2>
    <p>
      Jazan City is the agricultural heartland of the country. The milder temperature, 
      fertile soil, and groundwater allow the cultivation of tropical fruits like figs, 
      papayas, and mangos. 
      <br><br>
      The surrounding areas of the city are well-cultivated because of 
      new irrigation projects initiated by the government and have become one 
      of the main agricultural regions of Saudi Arabia. Crops produced in the 
      region include wheat, rice, barley, millet, and sorghum. 
      <br><br>
      The Tihamah coastal region is one of the hottest regions of the country. 
      Temperatures can rise above 45°C. It is not only hot but also humid in 
      these coastal regions. On the other side, the mountainous areas of the 
      region offer a much milder climate.

      promenade and enjoy the cuisine of the area. There are jogging tracks and 
      kids’ playgrounds in this location. The modern culture of the city can be 
      experienced firsthand in this location.
      <br><br>
      The local architecture displays in the city show the rich cultural 
      history of the city along with the Ottoman and Yemeni influences. 
      The city is well connected and roads link the port to its fertile hinterland.
