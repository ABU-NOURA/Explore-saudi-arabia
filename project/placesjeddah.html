    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      According to the Ministry of Hajj, Jeddah was founded as a small fishing village around 
      2500 years ago. The port city has held great significance not only due to commerce and 
      trade but also due to the fact that during the period of Caliph Uthman bin Affan, it served 
      as a port for pilgrims heading to Makkah to perform Hajj.
      <br><br>
      The city was fortified in the 16th century by the Turks. A stone wall was built to defend 
      the city against the Portuguese. Since Jeddah remained under Ottoman rule until 1915, 
      there is a strong Turkish influence visible in the city architecture.

    <h2>Geography</h2>

    <p>
      The long seashore is one of the most prominent features of the city. 
      Benefiting from this abundant seashore, the city of Jeddah built a 20 mile, 
      three-part corniche. The New Jeddah Corniche offers breathtaking views of 
      the Red Sea and also offers many recreational facilities that visitors 
      can benefit from. Keeping in line with the motto ‘Jeddah is Different’, 
      even the geography of the region offers a break from the endless sprawling 
      desert of Saudi Arabia. The beauty of the Red Sea enchants visitors and beckons 
      them to come back for more.   
      <br><br>
      Jeddah is the 100th largest city in the world by land area. It is situated on a 
      coastal plain in the lower Hijaz mountains. The climate of the city is classified as 
      arid and it retains its warmth even in the colder months.
